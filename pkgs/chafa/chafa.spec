# Ported from terrapkg/packages frawhide on 2026-09-22 and
# adapted to this repo's Copr custom-source pipeline. Deviations from upstream:
#   * Name drops the terra- prefix (that is Terra's repo-wide convention for
#     packages that also exist in Fedora; there is no clash to avoid here).
#   * pkg_libs_files / pkg_devel_files / pkg_static_files are
#     auto-file-lists — replaced with explicit files lists.
#   * evr -> %{version}-%{release}.
#   * the .la removal is unconditional (the %if 0%{?rhel} guard never fires on
#     Fedora, and an unpacked .la would fail the build).
# The source tarball is fetched by mock at SRPM-build time (this repo keeps
# downloads out of prep; network is on for URL sources).

%description
Chafa is a command-line utility that converts all kinds of images, including
animated image formats like GIFs, into ANSI/Unicode character output that can
be displayed in a terminal.

It is highly configurable, with support for alpha transparency and multiple
color modes and color spaces, combining a range of Unicode characters for
optimal output.
